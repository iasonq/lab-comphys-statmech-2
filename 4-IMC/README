Inverse MC: reconstruction of effective ion-ion potentials from RDFs

Input files:

NaCl_1M.rdf  :   file with RDFs (copyed from ../3-RDF)
Na+_SD.CG.mcm
Cl-_SD.CG.mcm  :  molecular description files for IMC / IBI procedure
	          (copyed from ../3-RDF)

Magic_NaCl.inp1 : main input file for the first series of iterations
Magic_NaCl.inp2 : main input file for the second series of iterations

Output files:

NaCl_IMC.out1		    : main lof file of MagiC execution during
                              the first series of iteration
NaCl.01.p001 - NaCl.01.p008 : Log files from each execution core during
                              the first series of iterations
NaCl.01.i001.pot - NaCl.01.i010.pot  : Files with computed potentials after
                              each iteration of the first series

NaCl_IMC.out2		    : main lof file of MagiC execution during
                              the first series of iteration
NaCl.02.p001 - NaCl.02.p008 : Log files from each execution core during
                              the first series of iterations
NaCl.02.i001.pot - NaCl.02.i010.pot  : Files with computed potentials after
                              each iteration of the first series

File NaCl.02.i010.pot contains resulting potential of the IMC procedure
